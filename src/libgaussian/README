=> Library Structure <=

Core Libraries (C++):
libcore - molecule, basis set, angular momentum

Ring1 Libraries (C++):
libmints - molecular integrals and schwarz sieve
libgrid - grid specification and collocation
libfunctional - local density functional specification and computation

Ring2 Libraries (C++/Tensor):
libob - S,X,Q,T,V, etc matrices, gradients and hessians
libdf - DF ERI tensors, gradients, etc
libjk - J/K matrices, gradients, and hessians
libvxc - Vxc matrices, gradients, and hessians

Rules:
(1) No inner ring libraries are allowed to refer to outer ring libraries
(2) Each library should do one major class of operations
(3) The computer model should be followed - build an object, tweak it, then ask
    it for results
